left off having completed test03 of intentional source/compiler errors for hello_world drill
todo: continue error testing and checking how the compiler logs info of those errors to console for debug practice, but also get on with things
	'cause this debug stuff is dull.
remember: git command sequence for adding modified files, then committing the changes, then pushing the changes to online repo:
	git add <dir>	: where <dir> is the Stroustrup directory, ie. ~/Stroustrup:$ git add .
	git commit	: you'll get a vi prompt to provide a message for the commit, or add switch -m "comment"
	git push	: sends modifications to the repo - you can do multiple adds and commits while you work and just do one push at the end.

	git pull	: syncs changes from the online repo to the local machine's repo, for when you actually work from another system and come
				back to this one.
