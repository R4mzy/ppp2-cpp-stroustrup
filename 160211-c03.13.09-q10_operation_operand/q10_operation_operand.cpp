	Write a program that takes an operation followed by two operands and outputs the result. For example:
		+ 100 3.14
		* 4 5

	Read the operation into a string called operation and use an if-statement to figure out which operation the user wants, for example, if
	(operation=="+"). Read the operands 
	into variables of type double. Implement this for operations called +, â€“, *, /, plus, minus, mul, and div with their obvious meanings.
