/*
	Write a program that takes an operation followed by two operands and outputs the result. For example:
		+ 100 3.14
		* 4 5

	Read the operation into a string called operation and use an if-statement to figure out which operation the user wants, for example, if
	(operation=="+"). Read the operands 
	into variables of type double. Implement this for operations called +, â€“, *, /, plus, minus, mul, and div with their obvious meanings.

	// okay this approach didn't work, I get compiler errors which I think indicate declaring the operator variable with the std::function/std::plus method isn't working. I don't know. I'll just if it all out instead.

	strange thing: I originally used single-quotes/apostrophes to enclose the operand characters, eg. '*' rather than "*". This seems to have been a problem, with the compiler 
	throwing tons of errors. Perhaps that kind of quote must be used with chars and not strings...
