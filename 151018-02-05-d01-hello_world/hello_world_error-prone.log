hello_world_error-prone.cpp: In function ‘int main()’:
hello_world_error-prone.cpp:7:2: error: ‘cout’ was not declared in this scope
  cout << "Hello, World!\n";
  ^
hello_world_error-prone.cpp:8:19: error: ‘keep_window_open’ was not declared in this scope
  keep_window_open();
                   ^
* can see error is given as "file:line:char" followed by the problematic code element and then followed by the actual line
* in this case, functions I am calling ( cout() and keep_window_open() ) are defined in std_lib_facilities.h which, as far as the compiler was
* concerned, was not included in the source so there's nothing for it to reference how those functions work or what they do...

hello_world_error-prone.cpp:6:31: fatal error: stdlib_facilities.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.

* somewhat expectedly, intentional misspelling of std_lib_facilities.h results in compiler trying to include a file that doesn't exist, and 
* therefor stopping compilation
