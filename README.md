This project serves as a directory used for storing files, notes, code, programs, etc. that are made whilst following Programming - Principles and Practice Using C++ by Bjarne Stroustrup.

Folder name standard:
date-chapter-thingNumberForThisChapter-typeAndNumber-partNumberOfType-name

date: YYMMDD <br>
chapter: chXX, ie. ch01, ch02, etc. <br>
thingNumberForThisChapter: number for which "thing" this is under the chapter. The first "activity", be it test code to try, or a drill, or an exercise. ie, numeral XX, ie. 01, 04, etc. <br>
typeAndNumber: the type of "thing" and number of thing in this chapter. types are a = activity, d = drill, e = exercise, etc. ie, d01. <br>
partNumberOfType: a certain drill or exercise may have multiple parts or questions to it, this number tracks those. ie, an exercise, e01, calls for building two different programs for different things, so you'd have e01-01 and e01-02. <br>
name: name for "project" - where a certain project/exercise/whatever sees further work in a second exercise or drill, it will be copied to a new branch & folder and expanded upon in the new directory  <br>
